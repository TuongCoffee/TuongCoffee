## Why did I make this repository?

Just for fun :)

### 1. Learning to script

This repository was created to help me learn scripting using different programming languages, mainly **TypeScript (.ts)** and **JavaScript (.js)**, with the help of **ChatGPT**.

I currently don’t have a teacher guiding me, so I use ChatGPT to **learn**, **practice**, and improve my skills step by step.

### 2. Making stuff

This repository also stores some of my work so others can use it if they find it useful.

### 3. Testing and experimenting

Some files and data here are used for testing scripts and experimenting with different ideas.  
It’s part of my learning process.
