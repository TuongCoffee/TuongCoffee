## About this repository

### Why did I make this repository?

Just for fun :)

#### 1. Learning to script

This repository was created to learn scripting using multiple programming languages, mainly `.ts` or `.js` (JvaScript or TypeScript), with the help of **ChatGPT**.  
I don’t currently have a teacher to guide me, so I use ChatGPT to **learn**, **practice**, and improve my **skills** step by step.

#### 2. Making stuff

This repository also stores some of my work so others can use it too.  
Please give **credit** if you reuse any part of my work.

#### 3. For testing scripts

This repository includes lists, arrays, and other data used for testing scripts.  
For example, if you want to write a script that fetches or processes data from the Internet, this repository can be useful.

### What’s in this repository?

This repository contains a lot of scripts created throughout my *learning journey*.  
The code reflects my process of *learning*, *experimenting*, and *improving* my understanding of scripting over time.
