## About *myself*

Hi! im TuongCoffee. You can call me Tuong. Im just a beginner programmer born in 2014 and from Vietnam.

### How did I learn about programming?

It's a ***long*** story.

So.. umm.. for real, I **learn about coding** from like when I was **11 or 12.**  
When I was 11 or 12, I want to *hacks* in Roblox <sub>( lol )</sub>, so i started researching *"hOw To HaCk iN rObLoX"* and I found **Happymod** - a platform that contains *safe-modded* apps and games ( *NOT SPONSORED* ). I search for Roblox and I install it but it's ***sucks*** ( i have experience from downloading apks to avoid viruses ). So **I began searching more and more** until I found Executors, like *Delta*, *Fluxus*, *Krnl* that **can run scripts in Roblox *client.*** I run some scripts I found on *Youtube and Google* and it is very fun! Btw I expiloting not hacking, I mean, **I expilot to make others laugh not ruin othes experience with the game.**

After this long journey with expilot. I started thinking, *"Why not make my own script?"*, so I learn about scripting, programming, coding or something. And **I began to fell in love with it!** ( when I started learn about coding, it is Luau - a scripting language from Roblox ) But my scripts **sucks** and I used Chat-GPT to write codes. And I stopped learing because I dont have conditions. That's it. <sub>The end.</sub> Thanks for readi- just kidding, it's not ended.

### Fav things

I loves some colors like *blue sky*, *blue*, *black*, *purple*, etc.  
I LOVES ICECREAM.  
I loves coding like i said up there.  
Idk what to say more.

### Fav films and games

My fav film is *Interstellar* and more! I cant list all of it because I watch it without knowing the name of the film.  
My fav game is *Stray* because it make me **cry** at the ending so much 😭.


## About this repository

### Why did I make this repository?

Just for fun :)

#### 1. Learning to script

This repository was created for learning scripting using multiple programming languages, mainly `.js` (JavaScript), with the help of *ChatGPT*.  
I don’t currently have a teacher to guide me, so I use **Chat-GPT** to learn, practice, and improve my skils step by step.

#### 2. Making stuff

This repository also store some of my stuff so others can use it too!  
Remember to credit if u want to make somthing that's contain my stuff.

#### 3. For testing script

In here, it will have some list, array, etc to test your code.  
Like, you want to make a script thats gonna take some data from the Internet. This repository is for you.


### What’s in this repository?

Contains alot of scripts created throughout my *scripting learning process*.  
The code here represents my ongoing journey of *learning*, *experimenting*, and *expanding* my understanding of scripting over the days.
