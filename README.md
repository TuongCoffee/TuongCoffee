# Hello! I'm TuongCoffee 👋

Hi! I'm TuongCoffee, but you can call me **Tuong**.  
I'm a beginner programmer from **Vietnam**, currently learning and building scripts step by step.

## Learning journey

### Back from the beginning

This story starts with hacking. Literally.

I started learning programming when I was around **11–12 years old**, mainly because I wanted to use **Roblox scripts**.  
At first, I wasn’t interested in programming itself. I just wanted to **hack**.

I searched for things like *“Roblox hack scripts”* and found executors such as **Delta**, **Fluxus**, and **Krnl**, which allowed scripts to run inside the Roblox client. I used scripts from YouTube and Google, experimented with them, and tried different things.

That phase was fun, but it didn’t last.

After a while, I started thinking:

> *“Instead of using other people’s scripts… why don’t I make my own?”*

That was the turning point.

### From hacking to scripting

Once I tried writing my own scripts, everything changed.

I started learning **Luau**, the scripting language used in Roblox. At first, my scripts were messy, simple, and sometimes broken. I used **ChatGPT** to understand syntax and concepts, but most of the learning came from trial and error, like Geometry Dash, lol.

Somewhere along the way, I **fell in love with scripting**.

I almost instantly stopped using hacks and executors, not because someone told me to, but because **writing my own code was far more interesting, fun, and rewarding**.  
I started caring more about *how things worked* than *what advantages I could gain*.

That’s when hacking stopped being the goal.

## Today

I paused my learning a few times (each time was about half a year) since I was still young and financially dependent on my family.  
Now, I’m back. Learning programming properly, exploring new tools, and building projects at my own pace.  

Currently, I mainly work with **JavaScript (.js)** or **TypeScript (.ts)**.

This repository represents that journey.

## Development Environment

Terminal: Termux (Android)  
Code editor: Acode  
Device: Samsung Galaxy A11 *(low-end device with limited storage, so I prefer lightweight tools)*

## Notes

My repositories reflect my learning process.  
Some projects may be experimental or unfinished.  
The goal is understanding, not perfection.
