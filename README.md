# Hello! I'm TuongCoffee!

Hi! I'm TuongCoffee. You can call me Tuong.  
I'm a beginner programmer, born in 2014, and from Vietnam.

### How did I learn about programming?

It's a ***long*** story.

So… umm… for real, I **started learning coding** when I was **around 11 or 12**.  
At that time, I wanted to experiment with scripts in Roblox <sub>( lol )</sub>, so I started researching things like *"how Roblox scripts work"*.  

I discovered platforms like **Happymod** — a place that contains *safe-modded* apps and games (*NOT SPONSORED*).  
I tried Roblox mods, but they weren’t very good, so I kept searching until I found script executors like *Delta*, *Fluxus*, and *Krnl* that could run scripts inside the Roblox client.

Running scripts I found on *YouTube* and *Google* was really fun.  
Also, I want to clarify that I was **experimenting with scripts**, not hacking. I only used them to make others laugh, not to ruin anyone’s experience.

After that journey, I started thinking:  
*"Why not make my own script?"*

That’s when I began learning scripting and programming — and I **fell in love with it**.  
The first language I learned was **Luau**, a scripting language used in Roblox.

At first, my scripts weren’t very good, and I sometimes used **ChatGPT** to help write code.  
Eventually, I stopped learning for a while due to personal limitations.

That’s it. <sub>The end.</sub>  
Thanks for readi— just kidding, it’s not over yet.

### Stuffs

I currently use Termux as my main terminal.
I code with Acode, a code editor for Android.

My device is a low-end Samsung Galaxy A11.
It has only a few gigabytes of free storage.
